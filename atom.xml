    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" class="aplayer-secondary-style-marker" href="/assets/css/APlayer.min.css"><script src="/assets/js/APlayer.min.js" class="aplayer-secondary-script-marker"></script><script class="meting-secondary-script-marker" src="/assets/js/Meting.min.js"></script><p>So I stopped at a Jack in the Box in the way here, and the girl behind the counter said, hiya, are you having an awesome day? </p><p>Not, how are you doing today? </p><p>No, are you having an awesome day? Which is pretty shitty because it puts the onus on me to disagree with her. Like, if I’m not having an awesome day, suddenly I’m the negative one. Usually when people ask how I’m doing, the real answer is, I’m doing shitty. But I can’t say I’m doing shitty because I don’t even have a good reason to be doing shitty. So if I say I’m doing shitty, then they say, why? What’s wrong? And I have to be like, I don’t know all of it. </p><p>So instead, when people ask how I’m doing, I usually say, I am doing so great. But when this girl at the Jack in the Box asked me if I was having an awesome day, I thought, well, today I’m actually allowed to feel shitty today. I have a good reason. So I said to her, well, my mom died, and she immediately burst into tears, so now I have to comfort her, which is annoying. And meanwhile, there’s a line of people forming behind me who are all giving me these real judgy looks because I made the Jack in the Box girl cry. And she’s bawling, and she’s saying, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. And I’m like, it’s fine, it’s fine. I mean, it’s not fine, but, you know, it’s fine. And I would like to order a double Jack meal, and I’ve kind of got somewhere to be. So maybe less with the crying and more with the frying, huh? And the girl apologizes again, and she offers me a free churro with my meal. And as I’m leaving, I think I just got a free churro because my mom died. </p><p>No one ever tells you, when your mom dies, you get a free churro.</p><p> Let’s do this. Here I am, BoJack Horseman, doing a eulogy. Beatrice Horseman. Who was she? What was her deal? Well, she was a horse. She was born in 1938. She died in 2018. One time she went to a parade. And one time, she smoked an entire cigarette in one long inhale. I watched her do it. Truly a remarkable woman. </p><p>Live a full life, that lady. Just all the way to the end, which is now, I guess. Really makes you think, though, huh? Life, right? Goes by, stuff happens, then you die. Hmm. Here’s the story. When I was a teenager, I Performed a comedy routine for my high school talent show. There was this cool jacket that I wanted to wear because I thought it would make me look like Albert Brooks. For months I saved up for this jacket. But when I finally had enough, I went to the store and it was gone. They just sold it to someone else. So I went home and I told my mother, and she said, let that be a lesson. That’s the good that comes from wanting things. She was really good at dispensing life lessons that always seemed to circle back to everything being my fault. </p><p>But then, on the day of the talent show, my mother had a surprise for me. She had bought me the jacket. And even though she didn’t know how to say it, I knew this meant that she loved me. Now, that’s a good story about my mother. It’s not true, but it’s a good story, right? I stole it from an episode of Maude I saw when I was a kid. When she talks about her father. I remember when I saw it thinking, that’s the kind of story I want to tell about my parents when they die. But I don’t have any stories like that. All I know about being good, I learned from tv. And in tv, flawed characters are constantly showing people they care with these surprising grand gestures. And I think that part of me still believes that’s what love is. </p><p>But in real life, the big gesture isn’t enough. You need to be consistent. You need to be dependably good. You can’t just screw everything up and then take a boat out in the ocean to save your best friend or solve a mystery and fly to Kansas. You need to do it every day, which is so hard. When you’re a kid, You convince yourself that maybe the grand gesture could be enough. That even though your parents aren’t what you need them to be, over and over and over again, at any moment, they might surprise you with something wonderful. I kept waiting for that. The proof that even though my mother was a hard woman, deep down she loved me and cared about me and wanted me to know that I made her life a little bit brighter. Even now, I find myself waiting. </p><p>Hey, Mom. Knock once if you love me and care about me and want me to know that I made your life a little bit brighter. </p><p>I was in the hospital with her those last moments, and they were truly horrifying, full of nonsensical screams and cries. But there was this moment, this one instant of strange calm, where she looked in my direction and said, I see you. It’s the last thing she said. </p><p>To me, I see you. Not a statement of judgment or disappointment, just acceptance and the simple recognition of another person in a room. Hello there. You are a person, and I see you. Let me tell you, it’s a weird thing to feel at 54 years old that for the first time in your life, your mother sees you. It’s an odd realization that that’s the thing that you’ve been missing. The only thing that you wanted all along to be seen. And it doesn’t feel like a relief to finally be seen. It feels mean, like, oh, turns out that you knew what I wanted and you waited until the very last moment to give it to me. I was prepared for more cruelty. I was sure that she would get in one final zinger about how I let her down and about how I was fat and stupid and too tall to be an effective Lindy Hopper. How I was needy and a burden and an embarrassment. All that I was ready for, I was not ready for. I see you. Only my mother would be lousy enough to swipe me with a moment of connection on her way out. </p><p>But maybe I’m giving her too much credit. Maybe it wasn’t about connection. Maybe it was a. Maybe it was an ICU like u. I see you. Like, you might have the rest of the world fooled, but I know exactly who you are. That’s more my mom’s speed. </p><p>Or maybe she just literally meant I see you. You are an object that has entered my field of vision. She was pretty out of it at the end there, so maybe it’s dumb to try to attribute to anything. </p><p>Back in the 90s, I was in a very famous TV show called horsing around. Please hold your applause. And I remember one time a fan asked me, hey, um, you know that episode where the horse has to give Ethan a pep talk after Ethan finds out his crush only askeds him to the dance because her friends were having a dorky est date contest? In all the shots of the horse, you can see a paper coffee cup on the kitchen counter. But in the shots of Ethan, the coffee cup’missing Was that because the show was making a statement about the fluctuant subjectivity of memory and how even two people can experience the same moment in entirely different ways. And I didn’t have the heart to be like, no man. Some crew guy just left their coffee cup in the shot. So instead I was like, yeah, and maybe this is like that coffee cup. </p><p>Maybe we’re dumb to try to pin significance onto every little thing. Maybe when someone says, I see you it just means I see you. Then again, it’s possible. She wasn’t even talking to me. Because if I’m being honest, she wasn’t really looking at me. She was looking just past me. There was nobody else in the room, so I want to think she was talking to me, but honestly, she was so far gone at that point, who knows what she was saying? Who were you talking to? Mom. Not saying, huh? Maybe she saw my dad. My dad died about 10 years ago of injuries he sustained during a duel. When your father dies, you ask yourself a lot of questions. Questions like, wait, did you say he died in a duel? And who dies in a duel? The whole thing was so stupid. Dad spent his entire life writing this book, but he couldn’t get any stores to carry it or any newspapers to review it. Finally, I guess this one newspaper thought he was pretty hilarious because they ran a review and tore him to shreds. So my father, ever the proud Mary, decided he would not stand for this besmirchment of his honor. He claimed the critic didn’t understand what it meant to be a man. So he demanded satisfaction in the form of pistols. At daw, he wrote the paper this letter saying anyone who didn’t like his book, he would challenge to a duel. Anyone in the world. He’d even pay for airfare to San Francisco and a night in a hotel. Well, eventually this found its way to some kook in Montana who was as batshit as he was, and he took him up on the offer. They met at Golden Gate park and agreed. 10 paces, then shoot. But in the middle of the 10 paces, dad turned to ask the guy if he’d actually read the book and what he thought, but not looking where he was going, tripped over an exposed route and bashed his head on a rock.</p><p> I wish I’d known to go to Jack of the Box. Then maybe I could have gotten a free churro. Would have been nice to have something to show for being the son of Butterscotch Horseman. My darling mother gave the eulogy. My entire life, I never heard her say a kind word to or about my father. But at his funeral, she said, my husband is dead and everything is worse now. My husband is dead and everything is worse now. </p><p>I don’t know why she said that. Maybe she felt like that’s the kind of thing you’re supposed to say at a funeral. Maybe she hoped one day someone would say that about her. My mother is dead and everything is worse now. Or maybe she knew that he had frittered away all her inheritance and replaced it with crippling debt. Which is a pretty shitty thing to leave your widow with. Bad news, you lost a husband. But don’t worry, you also lost the house. Maybe mom knew she’d have to sell all her fancy jewelry, move into a home. Maybe that’s what she meant by everything is worse now. Is that what you meant, Mom? You know, the first time I ever performed in front of an audience, actually was with my mom. </p><p>She used to put on these shows with her supper club in the living room. And she’to make. She used to make me sing the lollipop song. Those parties, they were really something. There were skits and magic acts and ethnically insensitive vaudeville routines. And the big finale was always a dance my mother did. She had this beautiful dress that she only brought out for these parties. And she did this incredible number. They were so beautiful. And sad. Dad hated the parties. He’d lock himself in the study and bang on the walls for us to keep it down. But he always came out to see mom dance. He’d linger in the doorway, scotch in hand, and watch in awe as this cynical, despicable woman he married took flight. And as a child who was completely terrified of both my parents, I was always aware that this moment of grace, it meant something. We understood each other in a way, Me and my mom and my dad. As screwed up as we all were, we did understand each other. My mother, she knew what it’s like to feel your entire life like you’re drowning. With the exception of these moments, These very rare brief instances in which you suddenly remember you can swim. </p><p>But then again, mostly not mostly, you’re drowning. She understood that, too. And she recognized that I understood it. And dad, all three of us were drowning and we didn’t know how to save each other. But there was an understanding that we were all drowning together. And I would like to think that that’s what she meant. When we were in the hospital and she said, I see you. </p><p>You know, the weird thing about both your parents being dead is it means that you’re next. I mean, you know, obviously, it’s not like there’s a waitist for dying. Any one of us could get run over by Snapchatting teen at any moment. And you would think that knowing that would make us more adventurous and kind and forgiving, but it makes us small and stupid. And Patty, I actually had a near death experience recently. A stunt went bad and I fell off the building. I’m an actor and do my own stunts. You know what I thought when I was falling off that building and I went into panic mode, the last thing that my stupid brain could come up with before I died. Won’t they be sorry? I don’t even know what they I wanted to be sorry. My mom, even before she died, could barely remember who I was. And of course my dad’s dead. The last conversation I ever had with him was about his novel. He was so certain this book was his legacy. Maybe he thought it would vindicate him for all the shitty things he ever did in his stupid worthless life. Maybe he did. I don’t know. I never read it because why would I give him that? </p><p>I used to be on this TV show called Horsing Around. It was written by my friend Herb Kazazz, who’s also dead now, and it starred this little girl named Sarah Lyn. And it was about these orphans. And early on the network had a note. Maybe dont mention their orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not relatable. But I never thought the orphans were sad. I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted they had something to long for. Anyway, we did this one season finale where Olivias birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but shes gotten herself cleaned up and she wants to be in Olivias life again. And of course shes like a perfect grown up version of Olivia and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she’s always wanted and sorry. Spoiler alert for the season six finale of Hors and Around if you’re still working your way through it. Anyway, the horse tries to warn her. Be careful. Moms have a way of letting you down. But Olivia just thinks the horse is jealous. And when the mom says she’s moving to California, Olivia decides to go with her. And the network really juiced the cliffhanger is Olivia gun for good. And but of course because it’s a TV show, she’s not gone for good. Of course, because it’s a TV show. Olivia’s mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab so Olivia had to hitchhike all the way home. Of course that’s what happened because what are you gonna do? Just not have Olivia on this show? You can’t have happy endings and sitcoms. Not really. Because if everyone’s happy the show would be over. And above all else, the show has to keep going. </p><p>There’s always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or Unrealistic. But there’nothing more realistic than that. You never get a happy ending. Cause there’s always more show, I guess. Until there isn’t. My mom would hate it if she knew that I spent so much time at her funeral talking about my old TV show. Or maybe she’d think it was funny that her idiot son couldn’t even do this right. Who knows? She left no instructions for what she wanted me to say. </p><p>All I know is she wanted an open casket and her idiot son couldn’t even do that right. I’m not gonna stand up here and pretend I ever understood how to please that woman. Even though so much of my life has been wasted in vain attempts to figure it out. But I keep going back to that moment in the I seeu when she looked at me and I see you. I see you. </p><p>Jesus Christ. We were in the intensive care unit. She was just reading her sign. My mom died and all I got was this free churro. You know, this shittiest thing about all of this is when that stranger behind the counter gave me that free churro. That small act of kindness showed more compassion than my mother gave me her entire goddamn life. Like, how hard is it to do something nice for a person? This woman at the Jack in the Box didn’t even know me. I’m your son. All I had was you. </p><p>I have this friend. And right around when I first met her, her dad died. And I actually went with her to the funeral. And months later, she told me that she didn’t understand why she was still upset because she never even liked her father. It made sense to me because I went through the same thing when my dad died. And I’m going through the same thing now. You know what it’s like? It’s like that show Becker, you know, with Ted Danson. I watched the entire round of that show hoping that it would get better, and it never did. It had all the right pieces, but it just could’put them together. And when it got canceled, I was really bummed out. Not because I liked the show, but because I knew it could be so much better. And now it never would be. And that’s what losing a parent is like. It’s like, Becker. </p><p>Suddenly you realize you’ll never have the good relationship you wanted. And as long as they were alive, even though you’d never admited part of you, the stupidest goddamn part of you was still holding on to that chance. And he didn’t even realize it until that chance went away. My mother is dead and everything is worse now, because now I know I will never have a mother who looks at me from across a room and says, bojack Horseman, I see you. </p><p>But I guess it’s good to know. It’s good to know that there is nobody looking out for me. That there never was and there never will be. It’s good to know that I am the only one that I can depend on. And I know that now. And it’s good. It’s good that I know that. So it’s good my mother’s dead. Well, no point beating a dead horse. Beatrice Horseman was born in 1938, and she died in 2018. And I have no idea what she wanted. Unless she just wanted what we all want. To be seen.</p>]]></content>

src="https://p.ipic.vip/92650v.jpg"></p><p>——src pixabay</p><p>我觉得日本对我来说是一个动画、小说、电影包围的收藏册，现在终于到那边，反而要不适应了。</p><p>成田机场落地，没想到离市内这么远，这个机场的实际位置在千叶市，了解没有太多。从千叶到市内走的是到浅草的JR，从地铁看到外面县城层层叠叠的一户建，地铁的播报，身边形形色色的面孔还有晒到雀黑的中学生，超兴奋！</p><p>落地就到了浅草（因为定的酒店离这边还蛮近），下午看到了大街上的人群，五颜六色的招牌，感觉哪里都和大陆不一样，又哪里都相似。skytree非常突兀非常漂亮，美中不足的是旁边卧着一个水滴形状的<strong>便便蛋</strong>（后来才知道是因为高度限制，所以倒下来的啤酒花雕塑，朝日，原谅我一次）。<img src="https://p.ipic.vip/yr4smu.png"></p><p>在日本吃的第一顿饭是鸟贵族，做烧鸟的，我觉得过焦了。但是饮品和拉面味道还不错。</p><p>看了大雷门，不太喜欢神社文化所以没有抽签。</p><p>东京是一个巨大的城市群，浅草、涉谷、新宿、港区，等等等等聚集在一起</p><p>和看日文站台比起来，看英文似乎会更方便一些。一方面是日文报站听不懂，另一方面是Google map的英文更精准、指示更清楚。而且英文的shibuya，Shinjuku，akihabara tokyo Kyoto Osaka等等等等，是完全音译的，用英文和日本人描述起来他们更容易理解</p><p>中日的文字类似让交互徒增烦恼。</p><hr><p>去了<strong>TOKYO CONFIDENTIAL</strong>，亚洲top50，主题酒单是棒球（但是MLB，没有日本本土棒球的西武狮队，遗憾），一杯古典开头，以不知道加了多少肉桂的辣嗓子特调收尾。能看到东京塔的露台非常美，但美好只持续了十分钟——冬天的露台太冷了。店员的英文很差劲。和旁边的港人聊了很多，从东京和香港的区别，签证，旅行的方式，学校、专业、生活等等，乱七八糟。不知道什么原因这哥们一眼就看出了我是计科的，厉害。</p><p><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/4npwqj.jpg"></p><hr><p><strong>涉谷sky</strong>很棒，很美，大开大合的透明玻璃，带着艺术设施的长廊，俯瞰整个涩谷的巨型天台，从下午呆到了太阳落山。天气还算不错，能看到富士山的剪影（不过也只有个剪影）电梯看上去就那样，因为在半空中所以比较新奇</p><p>找了一对陌生的韩国情侣帮忙拍照，感谢思密达。</p><p><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/hnpznl.jpg"></p><hr><p><strong>巨型的城市，呼吸的城市！</strong>川流不息的车辆穿梭在斑斓内透的黑色大楼里，望不到边的天际线，同色系的、此起彼伏的玻璃大山延绵到看得见的地方，看不见的地方。大块大块的LED挂在空中、投在一片片的人群身上。听着初中在电视前边放边唱的glassy sky，幻想自己披着黑色的斗篷蹲在楼顶上帅帅的摆pose</p><p><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/6sjrsa.jpg"></p><h3 id="很多新鲜食材"><a href="#很多新鲜食材" class="headerlink" title="很多新鲜食材"></a>很多新鲜食材</h3><h3 id="（第一次接触的新鲜，不是日期的新鲜）"><a href="#（第一次接触的新鲜，不是日期的新鲜）" class="headerlink" title="（第一次接触的新鲜，不是日期的新鲜）"></a>（第一次接触的新鲜，不是日期的新鲜）</h3><p><strong>生蛋</strong> 拌饭里，拌面里，拌肉里，味道都还不错。</p><p><strong>山药泥</strong> 拌来拌去（口感意外不错！）</p><p><strong>纳豆</strong> 拌来拌去（店里不配备纸巾导致拉丝拉的手上、筷子上碗上都是，非常狼狈）</p><p><strong>蓝鳍金枪鱼</strong> 近些年很流行，吃到了一个烤制的版本，像是嫩化的牛舌</p><p><strong>托罗鱼蓉</strong> 一坨生鱼肉馅（长得非常吓人，像猪肉），本身没有什么味道，需要加酱油和山葵。继上次在上海吃的塔塔牛肉后又来个这，狭义上的人生肉馅历险应该只差德国的生猪肉糜吐司了。（生鸡肉由于过于危险+没有地方的风俗是这玩意，pass）</p><p><strong>一些莫名其妙的鱼类</strong> 在寿司拼盘里吃到，一顿四百，钱包大出血。店员和我一一介绍了每贯分别是什么，只记得金枪、厚蛋烧和生肉糜军舰。肉糜做得很一般，我还是更倾向塔塔牛肉的做法。</p><hr><h3 id="伪电气白兰"><a href="#伪电气白兰" class="headerlink" title="伪电气白兰"></a>伪电气白兰</h3><p>去了从大一就想去的<strong>快活club</strong>，一家有餐饮供应的单间网吧。日本除了横滨的流浪汉聚集地外，网吧难民算是倒数第二大的流浪汉人群了。他们会住在网吧这种地方，洗澡、吃饭、睡觉，打零工来生存。链接如下：</p><p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=j5bVWzTyJ7E&si=xtsniywjX8VjuqP0">https://youtube.com/watch?v=j5bVWzTyJ7E&amp;si=xtsniywjX8VjuqP0</a></p><p><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/m62z43.jpg"></p><p>老实说我之前一直对东京的小户型装修很向往，包括自己之前的实习也有在做建筑行业这一块，真住进去之后压抑程度实在是夸张，佩服。</p><p>值得一提的是，日本流浪汉的流浪理由很多和美国类似。作为一个预约&#x2F;信用制社会，没有固定的住所就意味着无法办理手机号&#x2F;银行卡&#x2F;股份购买&#x2F;选票等事项，又因为没有固定的信息导致无法工作，无法工作就没有收入，只能找便利店的日结零工，没有收入导致没有固定住所，恶性循环。</p><p>只是简单的注册快活club的APP进行入会员就需要手机号码&#x2F;护照照片&#x2F;护照号&#x2F;家庭具体到街道的详细地址以及姓名&#x2F;日文姓名，这在刷下身份证就直接开户的大陆网咖看起来是不可理喻的。（最后通过网路上搜到的某位杜撰人士地址信息注册成功了桀桀桀桀桀）</p><p>另外，虽然和大陆的网吧一样是win10，但是搜索引擎&#x2F;网咖导航页&#x2F;菜单栏等等都非常古老，有点像10s在QQ空间偷菜的那种网页感觉，换成google之后才松了口气。他们的键盘和输入法和中文类似，通过caps lock来切换中英文输出（但我不太能理解的是，国内的输入法通常是中文拼音&#x2F;英文，而日本似乎是日文拼音&#x2F;另一种日文拼音&#x2F;英文，多了一套另外的逻辑，是和五笔打字一样的部首输入法？还是需要切换到不同的字呢，那就不知道啦。）</p><hr><h3 id="动漫"><a href="#动漫" class="headerlink" title="动漫"></a>动漫</h3><p>去了<em><strong>你的名字</strong></em>  那部动画的取景地，感觉很奇妙，八年前看的电影能引着我到这里</p><p>位置在须贺神社⛩️（似乎是叫这个名字），在真正看到原片封面的现实取景地之后反而释然了。就算动画的建筑和现实里看起来再像，时间和空间在这一刻交叉——我真的爱这些建筑吗？似乎不是。动画之所以是动画，故事之所以能美好，是因为它是虚构的。</p><p>当我在某些事里沉迷的时候，或许沉迷的是我与它之间的空间，我喜欢的是那个在颅内创造出的、散发着无限可能性的版本</p><p><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/rw6jqb.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/ma4get.jpg"></p><p>在<strong>秋叶原</strong>看了很多电子设备、手办、游戏、书籍、其他周边，超巨幅的EVA壁画，街头排着队七扭八扭只为了吃碗面的本地人，只有沉浸在这些东西里之后才会感受到厌倦。一条条街上的扭蛋和娃娃机，塞满了五花八门的娃娃和奖品，坐在柏青哥赌博机前没完没了投进小钢珠的大叔大妈，吵闹，繁杂，喘不过气。<strong>我不喜欢这种感觉。</strong> 但总的来说，对于动漫迷们，一定是个挖不完的宝藏区域，加油啦。</p><p><img src="https://p.ipic.vip/hp99za.jpg"></p><hr><h3 id="Modal-Soul"><a href="#Modal-Soul" class="headerlink" title="Modal Soul"></a>Modal Soul</h3><p><img

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>前些天听到一个概念，说人除了生理上，其他的痛苦都是幻想出来的。我觉得正确，但这正是人和其他动物不同的地方</p></blockquote><h3 id="人非人"><a href="#人非人" class="headerlink" title="人非人"></a>人非人</h3><p>得益于偏向回避型依恋的人格，对人的相处容易在过多和过少间摇摆，比较难以得到稳定的距离融洽的关系。 萨特认为，人的存在先于他的本质，人的本质是他自由选择的结果。</p><p>某些存在的痛苦，通过某个meme得到（流传性较广的meme具有一定普适性）有可能是因为缺乏一个稳定靠谱的人给予解决方案，处理生活，但很明显这种依附的生活是不正确的，选项没有完美的、绝对的，生活是网状布局选项和结果的交叉</p><p>我们能够自由掌控自己的生命，哲学上称之为“主体性”。我是主体，意味着我有主导权，而别人就是客体。但是每个人都是主体，谁愿意成为客体呢？</p><p>每个人都会为了自我的主体性，而与他人展开斗争，每个人在和他人相处的时候，都想把他人变成客体。就像在日常的社交关系中，我们都希望自己是掌控者一样，掌控感会给我们安全感。那我们是如何把他人变成客体的呢？就是通过对他人的：“凝视”。</p><p>在他人的凝视下，我的存在和世界的存在发生了冲突和矛盾。我们是他人的美杜莎。</p><p>我终于意识到，我们的联络不过是巨大的幻觉。事实上，我们每个人都不过是在给自己发消息。</p><h3 id="物非物"><a href="#物非物" class="headerlink" title="物非物"></a>物非物</h3><p>我们被一部分鼓吹“想做什么就做什么”的所谓“勇敢者”骗了。</p><p>所有人都被惯坏了，欲望阙值达到了非常高的标准，需要无穷无尽的刺激和快节奏生活</p><p>需要不断的刺激，哪怕是坏的，动荡的 </p><p>因为没有办法接受安稳枯燥的生活</p><p>需要重建欲望体系，应当一些固定的自我提升开始</p><h3 id="我非我"><a href="#我非我" class="headerlink" title="我非我"></a>我非我</h3><blockquote><p>为什么你坐在那儿，看上去就像一个没写地址的信封？</p></blockquote><p>这一章和前面写的隔了两周左右，可能会进行后续的完善，让整篇完整</p><p>疏离了社交媒体一整天，对大家的话疏于回复，和他们的沟通更像一种任务，是在裂了缝的碗里倒水，流到地上，沾湿鞋底</p><p>我总是会翻相册，相册里有很多保存下来的瞬间，总是想，好像经历了这么多事，最后什么也没得到，会不会很好笑；一些聊得来的朋友，一些聊不来的朋友，文字在表达爱意的时候那么无力，表达恨意的时候却又很锋利</p><p>11.8更新</p><p>​我明白了，当你望向银河的时候，想看到的一定是点点繁星，而不是行星间的间隙；就像相册记录的是好的&#x2F;坏的一瞬间一样，那些当时的尴尬，苦涩和烦闷，都会由时间的跨度来抹平</p><p>查阅了一些资料，某些学者说，“我们研究了人与人之间的差异。总是或经常感到孤独的人，往往对他人抱有不信任的态度。”</p><p>“你变得非常封闭。你要独自处理许多事，以至于当人们对你感兴趣的时候，你有时反而有防备心。这种孤独会让人感到极度虚弱。”</p><p>如果我整天待在家里，我很可能会发疯。所以我会去咖啡馆逛逛，花一些冤枉钱。这可能不是最健康、实用的对付孤独的方式，但这是一种能和人相处的方式。可以在人群中放空自己，这很好。</p><p>试图构建我的身份认同，我是盐盐，我喜欢忙碌的感觉。试图变得更有创造力</p><p>我觉得猫猫挺不过去了，拍了X光和血常规，给它按医生说的准备了很多药。生命和朋友一样是一种消耗品，只是它消逝的比我快一些</p><p>我不知道还能不能看到它爪子挠麻绳，在地上跑来跑去追树叶，爬上我肩膀撅屁股</p><p>猫猫走了 ，什么事也没发生，对吗？</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[TOC]</p><p>关于萧沆《解体概要》的书摘</p><blockquote><p>萧沆的独特性，其实就在于他开创了一种彻底的复仇思想。他不是作为一个在私人事件上，在社会学意义上受到污辱、伤害而需要复仇的人，在对抗存在的诱惑，或是信仰的挑逗；他是以一种一旦觉醒，便无法再被生命幻觉平息的怀疑，在抗击那些宰制人的力量。他复仇的对象就是人内心，包括他自己内心，那份耽于拟订计划、开创业绩的意志。萧沆的清醒是在他对意志自觉的拒斥上，他一生都在声讨意志编织的虚幻世界，坚决地否定构筑这一世界的实用法则。对于还有能力信仰的人，他抱以怀疑；但他真正痛恨的，还是发号施令的意志。</p><p>就是不想以步步为营的批判方法去抗拒存在、改革存在，向某种莫须有的美好前进；而是直接向神灵、向世界挥舞我们的破碎与残缺。</p><p>——译者宋刚</p></blockquote><h3 id="诳语"><a href="#诳语" class="headerlink" title="诳语"></a>诳语</h3><p>生命就得强暴时间才有内容。</p><p>人一旦失去保持淡漠的能力，便成了潜在的凶手</p><p>高贵只有一种，就在对存在的否定中，在俯瞰断壁残垣时，那一抹微笑里。</p><p>人究竟是被自已的火焰，还是他人替你准备的火焰吞没，其实并不那么重要：性格的真理总是需要以这样或那样的方式去付出代价。</p><p>生命若没有否定它的力量，将会令人无法忍受。我们掌握着可能的出路，掌控着逃亡的念头，所以可以轻而易举地便将我们自己废除，甚至在癫狂的极致之中，咳出这个宇宙。</p><p>看看你们四周：到处是传教的蛆；每一个机构都在发布一道福音；市政府跟庙堂一样都有它们的崇高，行政部门，有它们的规章一一这套专供猴子使用的形上学…人人都在尽力疗治人人的生活一 甚至连乞丐、连病入膏肓的人都在努力一全世界的大街上和医院里挤满了改革家。</p><hr><h3 id="省思"><a href="#省思" class="headerlink" title="省思"></a>省思</h3><p>谁的生存若不是一场既猛烈又模糊的痛，就永远也无法进驻问题当中，亦不能了解其危险。</p><p>睡眠是一种限制，睡眠是一种特权，睡眠让人可以反复回溯生命最低限度的幻想而浑然不觉。</p><p>人对接近愚昧所包含的意识丧失并不感到恐惧，但以完美为前景却与晕眩密不可分。是不完美使我们能高于上帝，是因为害怕失去这不完美，我们才要逃离神圣！</p><p>一种从不曾委身于焦躁的快感，从不曾在思想上回味过自身消亡的危险，不曾品尝过残忍而甜美的毁灭的人，永远也无法治愈死亡的纠缠：他将会受尽折磨，因为他会抵抗。</p><p>倦闷让我们看到的永恒不是对时间的超越，而是对它的毁弃，它成了灵魂因为没有了迷信而腐烂才得来的无限：一种平乏的绝对，在其中，什么也无法阻止事物空兜圈子，寻找它们的坠落。生命在疯狂中创生，在倦闷中解体。</p><p>我接受生活乃是出于礼貌：永远的反叛跟决绝的自杀一样，都是没品位的表现。人20岁时，要对苍穹及其掩藏的肮脏大动干戈；之后就该厌倦。悲剧姿态只匹配于一种可笑的延长青春期；可是要达到平淡小丑的境界，却还需要度过千重考验。</p><p>人一旦拒绝承认思想观念是可以相互替换的，就会发生流血…坚定的决心下面竖着一把尖刀；满怀激情的眼晴喻示着凶杀。像哈姆雷特那样犹豫不决的心灵，从来不曾伤害过谁：邪恶的原质就在人的意志的张力当中，在他不解寂寞闲静的低能中，在他普罗米修斯式的狂妄自大中。</p><p>口称魔鬼，只是用残存的一点神学，为我们一种暧昧的激动着色而已，因为我们的骄傲拒绝承认这是激动。可是，谁不了解那些惶恐，那些在面对黑暗王子之时的惊慌呢？我们的自负需要一个名号，一个伟大的名字，好给一种焦虑命名，因为如果这种焦虑只是生理性的，那它将非常可悲。而传统的解释在我们看来更窝心。一点点形上学的残羹冷炙也很对精神的胃口…</p><h4 id="衰败千面"><a href="#衰败千面" class="headerlink" title="衰败千面"></a>衰败千面</h4><p>假如，因为某个偶然因素或是一个奇迹，词语都飞走了，我们一定会陷入一种难以忍受的焦虑和茫昧。这突然的沉默会使我们遭受最残酷的苦刑。是使用概念使我们得以控制住惊慌。我们说：死亡一这一抽象说法使我们不必去感受死亡的无限与恐怖。为事物和事件命名之后，人就规避了那不可解释的东西：精神的活动是一场救命的骗局、一种掩盖练习；它使我们得以穿行于一种已被柔化的、舒适的、不准确的现实之中。</p><hr><h3 id="不解"><a href="#不解" class="headerlink" title="不解"></a>不解</h3><p>难道我们就永远只能是自然的产物，受制于其法则的掌控，长成一棵棵人树吗？</p><p>有一点却仍旧解释不了：假如说灵魂就那么一丁点东西，那我们的孤独感又是从何而来的呢？它占据怎样的一个空间？又是怎么一下子，就可以替代掉那消失的广袤现实呢？</p><p>如此多的虚空与不解有什么出路呢？我们抓住日子不放，因为想死的愿望太过逻辑， 因此也就毫无功效。假如生命有那么一条支持它的理由一一条清楚的、无可争辩的理由一那它便会消失；本能与成见若遇上真正的严谨就免不了灰飞湮灭。</p><p>一个人所忍受的痛苦，若具备明确的特质，他就无权抱怨：他毕竟还有事可做。大痛大苦的人从不会倦闷：病痛占据着他们，就如同悔恨滋养着罪人一般。任何一种强烈的苦痛都会引出一种虚假的充实感，给意识提供一种可怕的现实，叫意识无从规避；而在倦闷这时间的丧期当中，那份没有材质的苦痛，却不会给意识任何压力，迫使它采取任何积极的行动。如何医治一种不曾定位、模糊至极，攻袭身躯却不留痕迹，侵蚀灵魂却不着印纹的疼痛呢？这就仿佛一场大病过后，我们虽然活了下来，却被这病吸光了可能，抽干了注意力，竟然无力去填补苦痛消失、折磨退去之后显露的虚空。在时光中经历了如此的流浪以后，地狱也成了一湾避风港。在这种空洞而沮丧的忧伤中，什么也不能！我们停驻，除了我们眼前这日益蛀蚀的宇宙。</p><h4 id="不自杀联盟"><a href="#不自杀联盟" class="headerlink" title="不自杀联盟"></a>不自杀联盟</h4><p>由于很难同意别人给的任何理由，所以每一次在跟他们当中某一位分手的时候，都总是会有同一个问题冒出来：他怎么没去自杀呢？因为没别的事比想像别人的自杀更自然了。而一旦透过一种令人震惊又常在常新的直觉，隐隐意识到自已的无用，那谁也没有这么做就很费解了。除掉自己看上去是一种那么清晰、那么简单的行动！为什么会如此少见，为什么人人都避而不谈呢？因为，如果说理性驳斥了求生的饥渴，那么，使行动得以延续的无，却有一种比任何绝对还高超的力量；它点出了所有生者默不作声的反死同盟，它不仅是生存的象征，而且就是生存本身，它才是一切。这份无，这个一切，无法赋予生命一种意义，但它却使生命可以继续是其所是：即一种未自杀状态。</p><hr><h3 id="未定"><a href="#未定" class="headerlink" title="未定"></a>未定</h3><p>​<em>较为激进，笔者持保留态度。</em></p><p>你得挑选一隅理想的高地，孤独得可笑，或是一颗玩笑的星星，去反叛星云。你的生活因为忧伤而不负责任，嘲讽着自已的每一个时刻；然而，生命，就是对时间绵延的怜悯，就是一种舞动的永恒感觉，一种超越着自我，与太阳争辉的时间…</p><p>地上一切的神奇，当然还有天上的那些神奇，都是来源于一种长期的歇斯底里。神圣是心灵的地震，是坚信不疑导致的灭绝，是狂热感性至高的表述，是超验的畸形…一个受到神召之人与一个头脑简单的人之间，比起跟一个怀疑之人来说，有更多的共通之处。这便是信仰与无望的知识、未果的存在之间，存在的全部距离。</p><p>我们的真理并不比祖先的真理更有价值。在用概念撤换了他们的神话与象征之后，我们以为自己“进步”了；可是这些神话与象征却并不比我们的概念少表达什么。生命之树、蛇、夏娃和天堂，跟生命、知识、诱惑、无意识，都表示着同样的东西。神话当中善与恶具体的形象，跟伦理学中的恶与善走得一样的远。知识一在其深刻之处一永远也不会改变：会变的唯有它的布景。</p>]]></content>
